Version one: Given that the funciton uses an insertion sort as the main driver for the algorithm, the big O would be O(n^2). 

Version Two: Again, we take combining the arrays as a given amount of time and use a counting sort algorithm, which runs in O(k+n) time.

Version Three: Given that we are sorting what essentially comes down to an array of arrays, it would be nearly impossible to improve the space complexity of the problem. The big O of the given solution is O(n^2), since Ruby uses Quicksort at the language level.
