Binary Tree Delete

On average, a min tree insert takes around 3.6 times as long as a binary tree insert, probably due to my inefficient insertion algorithm. 
Finding a node seems to take a trivial amount of time either way, but it takes around 1/4 as long in a binary tree vs a min heap.
Deletion seems to take much longer in a binary tree than in a min heap. 
I would use a binary tree to store data that didn't need to be manipulated or deleted all that often. I would use a min heap for tasks such as keeping track of 
data processing: a process that requires working through the list in an ordered way and deleting often.
