1. Spatial Locality is a principle in memory management where data is accessed from a relatively confined space. Because of this principle, in a single dimensional array, a computer can pull and cache the data relating to an array because it has a guarantee that the data is located near the target data. Because reading from a cache is much faster than memory, arrays tend to see superior performance when compared to linked lists.
